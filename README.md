# The PWR House
## ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue)

## Description

As a soon-to-be bootcamp graduate, I am planning to work fully remote so that I can be flexible and available to my 4 children. Having worked full time from home in the past, while caring for my very young children, I recall the complicated daily struggle of balancing both work and family simultaneously. I created this application as a way to help organize parents working remotely, as well as provide a space for them to connect with one another for encouragement and co-strategizing. 

## Installation

In the terminal at the route of the project, enter npm install to install the dependencies for The PWR House.

2. From the terminal, use the local link provided by Vite, to view the application in your browser.

## Features
