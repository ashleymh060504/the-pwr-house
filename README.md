# <The PWR House>

## Description

As a soon-to-be bootcamp graduate, I am planning to work fully remote so that I can be flexible and available to my 4 children. Having worked full time from home in the past, while caring for my very young children, I recall the complicated daily struggle of balancing both work and family simultaneously. I created this application as a way to help organize parents working remotely, as well as provide a space for them to connect with one another for encouragement and co-strategizing.
